          <h2>Christopher Reepen</h2>
          <p>Hello, my name is <span class="potato">christopher</span>. I am a current student at
            Independence High School. I am here currently looking for an
            internship that will help me get a job down the line. I am
            Independent, able to take leadership, and I get the job done. I have
            volunteered at a summer camp for the last three years. At the summer
            camp I had to take attendance, do paperwork, and set up activities,
            which shows that iâ€™m independent and get the job done. I also had to
            lead some of the activities, take front when we were going on field
            trips, and deal with angry parents. Once i finish High School and
            the dev/mission program, I would like to get a job in the tech
            industry. I know that my skills will be a great benefit for your
            company. I would like to learn more about you and your success, may
            I have your email so we can schedule coffee or something?
